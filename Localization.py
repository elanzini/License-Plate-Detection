In this file, you need to define plate_detection function.
To do:
	1. Localize the plates and crop the plates
	2. Adjust the cropped plate images
Inputs:(One)
	1. image: captured frame in CaptureFrame_Process.CaptureFrame_Process function
	type: Numpy array (imread by OpenCV package)
Outputs:(One)
	1. plate_imgs: cropped and adjusted plate images
	type: list, each element in 'plate_imgs' is the cropped image(Numpy array)
Hints:
	1. You may need to define other functions, such as crop and adjust function
	2. You may need to define two ways for localizing plates(yellow or other colors)
